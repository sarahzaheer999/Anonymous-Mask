# Anonymous-Mask

## Summary

We live in a world where everything we do is being watched by someone or the other. Surveillance cameras are propagating like insects. Facial recognition makes it harder to go about in public or online without being identified. If people are acting badly, others can readily launch an online shaming campaign against them. They can snap cellphone photos of people, post them on the Internet and then invite others to identify the people and supply information about them. But these things take away people’s freedom of expressing themselves making them feel inhibited. Anonymous Mask is a conceptual piece of art expressing the importance of anonymity in today’s world. When a user looks into the front camera, the programme detects their emotion (sad or happy) and then displays an overlay of a mosaic of different facial features with the exact opposite emotion of what the user is actually doing (If frowning-Happy Face, If smiling-Sad Face)

## What next?

I wanted to give this a physical form where I'd project this programme on a white mask. However, due to coronavirus I was not able to to achieve that. If given the time and better circumstances, I'd like to do that.
